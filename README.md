Both UpdateMe and DatabaseManager are intended to be ran at the same time.
You have to configure an oauth.txt file in the SAME DIRECTORY as UpdateMe.py. This will be done automatically on compatible systems (graphical ones with a web browser).
Message /u/JewsOfHazard on reddit if you have any questions.
